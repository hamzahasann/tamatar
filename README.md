# Plantx-ai
##### Ai in agriculture. Detecting Tomato(plant) diseases.
For effective agricultural management, plant diseases must be promptly and accurately detected. In order to identify tomato illnesses from leaf photos, this research project
creates an AI-driven application utilising image processing andconvolutional neural networks (CNNs). The programme aims to enhance crop health, boost output, and advance 
sustainable farming. The programme allows for data-driven decisions, early disease diagnosis, and precision agricultural techniques by utilising cutting-edge technologies.
Analysis of the modelâ€™s performance reveals that version 5 is the most effective in identifying tomato leaf diseases. Agricultural practises may be improved, financial losses
could be minimised, and food security could be guaranteed with the effective application of AI-based disease detection. Extending the dataset, including multi-modal data, and
validating real-world implementation are some future research goals. As a result, this AI-based application represents a significant development in agriculture, providing 
farmers with a useful tool for managing disease and promoting sustainable agricultural methods.
